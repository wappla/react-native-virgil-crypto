# React Native Virgil Crypto + React Native 0.60.x
Due to [compatibility issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/25349) with `use_frameworks!` there is no easy way to make it work. We suggest you to upgrade to 0.61.x or higher and use [this example](../Example61) as a reference to setup your project.
